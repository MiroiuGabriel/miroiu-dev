Hello there! This is my first blog post ever, so thank you for reading.

    Before we dive deep into these optimizations we must understand why
    components re-render in React.

There are 3 reasons a component will re-render:

1. State changes - these occur when your component's state is altered.
2. Parent re-render - a parent component's state changes, leading to the recursive re-rendering of all its children.
3. Context value changes - this occurs when the values in the context, which components share, are modified.

</Callout>

Now that we've got a handle on why re-rendering happens, let's move on to discussing
on how we can improve performance.

# Passing state down

Let's look at the following example. Can you spot the issue?

```tsx
export function Component() {
	const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open</button>
			{isOpen ? <Popover> ? null}
			<HeavyComponent />
			<ReallyHeavyComponent />
		</div>
	);
}
```

We intend to trigger the popover when the button is clicked.
It might look fine but whenever the `isOpen` state changes the component re-renders its children that don't change,
which leads to poor performance.
So how can we fix this?

We could use `memo` to memoize the components and prevent unnecessary re-renders like this:

```tsx
const MemoizedHeavyComponent = memo(HeavyComponent);
const MemoizedReallyHeavyComponent = memo(ReallyHeavyComponent);

export function Component() {
	return (
		<div>
			<ButtonWithPopover />
			<MemoizedHeavyComponent />
			<MemoizedReallyHeavyComponent />
		</div>
	);
}
```

While this works, there is a better solution. We can simply move the state into its own component.

```tsx
export function ButtonWithPopover() {
	const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

	return (
		<>
			<button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open</button>
			{isOpen ? <Popover> ? null}
		</>
	);
}
```

Now whenever the state changes, only the `ButtonWithPopover` component will be re-rendered.
So the final code will look like this

```tsx
export function Component() {
	return (
		<div>
			<ButtonWithPopover />
			<HeavyComponent />
			<ReallyHeavyComponent />
		</div>
	);
}
```

# Components as children prop

Consider the following example:

```tsx
export function Component() {
	const [scrollY, setScrollY] = useState('');

	return (
		<div
			onScroll={({ currentTarget }) =>
				setScrollY(currentTarget.scrollTop)
			}
		>
			<HeavyComponent />
			<ReallyHeavyComponent />
		</div>
	);
}
```

Again, changing the state re-renders the heavy components which is unnecessary.
We can apply the previous optimization with a slight modification.

```tsx
export function WithScroll({ children }) {
	const [scrollY, setScrollY] = useState('');

	return (
		<div
			onScroll={({ currentTarget }) =>
				setScrollY(currentTarget.scrollTop)
			}
		>
			{children}
		</div>
	);
}
```

Here we pass our heavy components as `children` and they will be unaffected when state changes inside `WithScroll`.

```tsx
export function Component() {
	return (
		<WithScroll>
			<HeavyComponent />
			<ReallyHeavyComponent />
		</WithScroll>
	);
}
```

Why does this work? Because `children` is just syntax sugar for passing the prop `children`, so this means that the parent,
in this case `Component` has to re-render for it to do aswell.
We can write the component from above like this:

```tsx
export function Component() {
	return (
		<WithScroll
			children={
				<>
					<HeavyComponent />
					<ReallyHeavyComponent />
				</>
			}
		></WithScroll>
	);
}
```

# Components as props

What is wrong here?

```tsx
export function Component() {
	const [isCollapsed, setIsCollapsed] = useState(false);

	return (
		<div className="wrapper">
			<div className="menu">
				<SlowComponent />
			</div>
			<div className="content">
				<button onClick={() => setIsCollapsed(!isCollapsed)} />
				<VerySlowComponent />
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```

When `isCollapsed` changes the `SlowComponent` and `VerySlowComponent` have to re-render.
To prevent this we can pass our components as props and it will work the same way `children` do from [Components as children prop](#components-as-children-prop).

```tsx
export function Component({ menu, content }) {
	const [isCollapsed, setIsCollapsed] = useState(false);

	return (
		<div className="wrapper">
			<div className="menu">{menu}</div>
			<div className="content">
				<button onClick={() => setIsCollapsed(!isCollapsed)} />
				{content}
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```

And the final code is:

```tsx
export function ParentComponent({ menu, content }) {
	return (
		<Component menu={<SlowComponent />} content={<VerySlowComponent />} />
	);
}
```

Now, unless `ParentComponent` re-renders, whenever state changes inside `Component`, our `menu` and `content` props will be unaffected.
